# 0x
## Remote docker container
1. To get started first install [Docker, VS Code, and the Remote Development Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
2. Change directory to the `0x` folder and open in VSCode `code .`.
3. On the bottom right a VSCode pop-up should appear with a prompt to "Reopen in Container". If not, open the VSCode command palette with `Shift+Command+P`and search for `Remote Containers: Reopen in Container`.
4. Does your VSCode window now have an terminal with the prefix  `node âžœ /workspaces/0x (main) $` open? Great you did it!
