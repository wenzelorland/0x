Brownie comes with pre-configured networks which are addressable.
You can view the list of available networks through "brownie networks list".

Networks which are listed under the tab "Development" are all temporary networks.
After the scripts completes, these networks are erased and spun up fresh when a new script is executed.

Networks under "Ethereum" are persisted.

NOTE: For Infura, the PROJECT_ID is now called the API-Key under "ENDPOINTS" of the projects.
Deploying to the testnet:
brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network goerli

Once deployed to the network, everything that is deployed will be saved in the build/deployments folder for future references like contract addresses etc.
Changes to local blockchains will not be saved here.
